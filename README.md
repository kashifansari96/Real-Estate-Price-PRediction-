This  project walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction model. In which, I covered almost all data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE

After systematically testing several regression models, including Lasso and Decision Tree Regressors, I found that the Linear Regression model consistently delivered the best performance. With an accuracy exceeding 80%, the Linear Regression model proved to be the most effective in predicting real estate prices within the given dataset.

This project not only highlights the practical application of essential data science techniques but also demonstrates the importance of thorough model evaluation and selection. The integration of Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code as IDEs facilitated an efficient and streamlined workflow, further enhancing the project's success.

By leveraging these methodologies and tools, the project effectively showcases how data science can be utilized to derive actionable insights and predictive power in real-world scenarios such as real estate price prediction.
