<h2>Real Estate Price Prediction Website</h2>

This project walks through a step-by-step process of how to build a real estate price prediction model, covering almost all data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, grid search CV for hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, etc. Technology and tools wise, this project covers:

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE

After systematically testing several regression models, including Lasso and Decision Tree Regressors, I found that the Linear Regression model consistently delivered the best performance. With an accuracy exceeding 80%, the Linear Regression model proved to be the most effective in predicting real estate prices within the given dataset.

This project not only highlights the practical application of essential data science techniques but also demonstrates the importance of thorough model evaluation and selection. The integration of Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code as IDEs facilitated an efficient and streamlined workflow, further enhancing the project's success.

By leveraging these methodologies and tools, the project effectively showcases how data science can be utilized to derive actionable insights and predictive power in real-world scenarios such as real estate price prediction.

<h3>Website Deployment</h3>
Building on the predictive model, I later developed a website to make the real estate price prediction model accessible to users online. The website is deployed with:

- Backend Server: Hosted on Render.com
- Frontend: Deployed on Netlify
Website link :- https://homepricepredictionmodel.netlify.app/

To ensure seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, I introduced an API that facilitates data communication and model predictions. This integration allows users to input real estate features and receive price predictions directly through the website, making the model's functionality easily accessible and user-friendly.
