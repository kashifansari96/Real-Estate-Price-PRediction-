# Real Estate Price Prediction Model

This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction model, covering essential data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning using grid search cross-validation. The project systematically tests several regression models and selects the best-performing one for deployment.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Python** for model development
- **Numpy** and **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)** for model building and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** and **Visual Studio Code** as IDEs for development

## Key Concepts Covered
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Outlier Detection and Removal
- Feature Engineering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search CV
- K-Fold Cross-Validation

## Model Selection
After evaluating several regression models, including Lasso and Decision Tree Regressors, the **Linear Regression** model consistently delivered the best performance with an accuracy exceeding 80%. This model was chosen for deployment due to its effectiveness in predicting real estate prices within the provided dataset.

## Project Highlights
- Practical application of essential data science techniques
- Thorough evaluation and comparison of multiple models
- Streamlined workflow with integration of **Jupyter Notebook** and **Visual Studio Code**
- Demonstrates how data science can be applied to derive actionable insights and predictive power in real-world scenarios like real estate price prediction.

## Website Deployment
To make the real estate price prediction model accessible to users, I developed and deployed a website using **Streamlit**. The website allows users to input real estate features and get instant price predictions. 

### Deployment Details:
- **Backend Server**: Integrated using Streamlit
- **Frontend**: Developed and deployed using Streamlit
- **Website Link**: [Real Estate Price Prediction](https://your-streamlit-app-link)

The website features an API for seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, enabling user inputs to be processed and price predictions to be displayed in real-time.
